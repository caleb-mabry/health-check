## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Using NextJS as a base, you will need to run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to have the project running.

It is also important that you go to https://app.outerbase.com and generate an API Token for your database. Once you have done so, you should be able to set it in your environment variables so it can be accessed with `process.env.API_KEY`

## Contributing

This project was mainly created for the hackathon and a desire of mine. I will gladly be accepting contributions to this application but there are no promises how long this will stay up, so be warned! There are plans to expand the functionality of this application that I have outlined in my blog. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this project and happy coding :)
